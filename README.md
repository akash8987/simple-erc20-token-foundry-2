# Simple ERC-20 Token Foundry

A minimalist, high-quality implementation of a standard ERC-20 token using the OpenZeppelin library. This repository is designed for developers who want to understand the core mechanics of minting and burning tokens on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

## Features
- **Standard ERC-20:** Fully compliant with Ethereum standards.
- **Mintable & Burnable:** Includes administrative controls for supply management.
- **Foundry Ready:** Optimized for the fastest smart contract development toolchain.

## Quick Start
1. Install Foundry.
2. Run `forge build` to compile the contracts.
3. Run `forge test` to execute the automated test suite.

## Security
This contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries to prevent common vulnerabilities like overflow/underflow and unauthorized access.
